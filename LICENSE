Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only;
and

B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.

right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the

automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms
and conditions of this Public Licence.

conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so
restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or
sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive
attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

b. Other rights.

1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public Licence, nor
are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible,
the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public Licence.

3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the
exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any
voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor

Elements, this version or later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible Licence.

2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's Licence You apply. You
may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
which You Share Adapted Material.

Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted
under the Adapter's Licence You apply.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the
Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce,
and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
only;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You
have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights
(but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of
the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under

a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor
offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of

includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence
of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in
full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

(including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect,
incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages
arising out of this Public Licence or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been
advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in
a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver
of all liability.

SECTION 6 – TERM AND TERMINATION.

a. This Public Licence applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here.
However, if You fail to comply with this Public Licence, then Your rights under this Public Licence
terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:

1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your
discovery of the violation; or

2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to
seek remedies for Your violations of this Public Licence.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate
terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will
not terminate this Public Licence.

d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public Licence.

SECTION 7 – CementOTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated
by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated
herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public Licence.

reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could
lawfully be made without permission under this Public Licence.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public Licence is deemed unenforceable, it
shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the
provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public Licence without affecting the
enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public Licence will be waived and no failure to comply consented to
unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public Licence constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver
of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
