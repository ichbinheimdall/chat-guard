# Privacy Policy

Effective date: 6 May 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Chat Guard ("the Bot"), operated by HMD Developments, Inc. ("HMD", "we", "us"), collects and processes data in the course of providing automated moderation services on Discord.

## Data We Process

- Discord identifiers: Server (Guild) IDs, Channel IDs, User IDs, Role IDs
- Server configuration: filtered words, whitelists, enforcement toggles, mute duration, log channel ID
- Enforcement state: temporary lists for warning/mute workflows (BlueList/BlackList)

The Bot does not persist direct message content and does not store arbitrary message transcripts. Moderation log messages may include compact summaries (e.g., offending link or invite) as posted to a server’s designated log channel under the server’s control.

## Purpose of Processing

- Enforce server‑configured moderation policies
- Maintain auditability via moderation event logs
- Improve reliability and safety of community interactions

## Legal Basis

Operations are performed at the direction of server administrators who install and configure the Bot. HMD acts as a service provider for the server community.

## Retention

- Configuration persists until changed or removed by server administrators
- BlueList entries expire automatically after approximately two hours
- BlackList entries are removed after mute timeout elapses

## Security

- Access to operational systems is restricted and credentialed
- The Bot performs actions only within Discord permissions granted by the server

## Your Choices & Data Requests

Server administrators control the Bot’s configuration and can remove it at any time. Data deletion requests can be submitted to legal@hmddevs.org. We may request proof of server ownership or relevant authority before acting on requests.
